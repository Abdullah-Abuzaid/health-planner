## Health Planner

**

**Project main motivation**

	The primary motivation behind this project is to empower individuals to take control of their health and
	wellness journey by providing them with a personalized and customizable healthcare dashboard. By offering
	users a central hub to access and manage their health information, track progress, and receive tailored
	recommendations, we aim to promote proactive healthcare engagement, facilitate informed decision-making,
	and ultimately improve individual health outcomes and quality of life.

**Technology used**

	We decided to use Nextjs with Tailwindcss for the front-end As it empowers us to rapidly develop an
	MVP and will greatly help us later for backend.
